## Answer 
1. Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers
2. With AWS you pay only for the individual services you need, for as long as you use them, and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing.  AWS pricing is similar to how you pay for utilities like water and electricity.

4. Compute as a service (CaaS) is when computing resources are supplied on demand via virtual or physical resources as a service. It is usually priced by way of a consumption-based model. CaaS first emerged in 2006 and was the original cloud offering when Amazon EC2 first launched.
5. An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.

7. AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. We call each group of logical data centers an Availability Zone. Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZ's within a geographic area
8. AWS has made MORE THAN ONE availability Zones to Overcome the circumstances of any Natural Disaster if happens  then other availability Zones are for Disaster Recovery
