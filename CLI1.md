# Building AWS Cloud Infrastructure Using AWS CLI
## What is AWS CLI ?
The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool to manage AWS services. AWS CLI provides us with a tool to configure control and automate AWS services through scripts and commands.
### Project Description - AWS CLI👨🏻‍💻
* Create a key pair  
* Create a security group  
* Launch an instance using the above created key pair and security group.
* Create an EBS volume of 1 GB. 
* The final step is to attach the above created EBS volume to the instance you created in the previous steps.
⚡ To use AWS CLI, we need to download and install it on the top of Operating System,
> aws --version

⚡ To perform the above task assigned, we need to configure the IAM - User profile that I have already created earlier. & we can also configure our own aws profile by providing access key Id , Secret key Id , region.
```
aws_access_key_id= 
aws_secret_access_key= 
aws_access_key_id=
aws_secret_access_key=
```
