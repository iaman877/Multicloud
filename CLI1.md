# Building AWS Cloud Infrastructure Using AWS CLI
## What is AWS CLI ?
The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool to manage AWS services. AWS CLI provides us with a tool to configure control and automate AWS services through scripts and commands.
### Project Description - AWS CLIüë®üèª‚Äçüíª
* Create a key pair  
* Create a security group  
* Launch an instance using the above created key pair and security group.
* Create an EBS volume of 1 GB. 
* The final step is to attach the above created EBS volume to the instance you created in the previous steps.

‚ö° To use AWS CLI, we need to download and install it on the top of Operating System,
```
aws --version
```

‚ö° To perform the above task assigned, we need to configure the IAM - User profile that I have already created earlier. & we can also configure our own aws profile by providing access key Id , Secret key Id , region.

### STEP 1:
##            _‚ú® Creating a Key pair_
 Now we successfully Logged In to AWS Account . After these We have to create Private Key to connect to the ec2 Instance . For creating Key Pair we have command as :
 
 ```
 aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name iaman
 ```

 Now, we have our keypair ready and we can see that on the console too. 'iaman' is created successfully.

### STEP 2:
##  _‚ú®Creating a Security group_
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic, to create Security group we have the command as  :
```
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name  <value>  --description  <value>
```

So, we have our security group created.

### STEP 3:
## _‚ú®Launching an Instance using above created key pair and Security group_
Now we have to Launch one EC2 Instance using above Key pair and Security Group .To launch ec2 instance AWS CLI has command as :

```
aws ec2 run-instances   --security-group-ids   group_id   --instance-type _type_ --image-id ami_id   --key-name key_name  --count no_of_instance 
```

Our instance is now launched in ap-south-1a

### STEP 4:
##  _‚ú®Create an EBS volume of 1 GB_
After Launching EC2 Instance now we have to create one EBS Volume & this volume type will be general purpose SSD Volume.

```
aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id vol-0ef37a7b52cf3c87b--instance-id i-05bea6de1322b3aec--device /dev/xvdh
```

Our volume is now successfully created and we can see that in the Console of AWS.

### STEP 5:
## _‚ú® Attach the above created EBS volume to the instance that created in the previous steps._
To Attach EBS Volume to EC2 Instance we have command :
```
aws ec2  attach-volume   --volume-id volume_id   --instance-id instance_id  --device device_name
```
![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49730521/96339705-017c1980-10b4-11eb-8a9f-a1e10804b486.png)

Our volume is now successfully attached and we can see that in the Console of AWS.

### STEP 6:
## _‚ú®At last we have to Terminate the EC2 Instance_
Before Terminating the EC2 Instance, we first Detach the EBS Volume using command

```
aws ec2  detach-volume  --volume-id  volume_id
```
![14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49730521/96339857-c0383980-10b4-11eb-8fc3-8aeed72380ac.png)
To Terminate the EC2 Instance use command :
```
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids  instance_id
```

## ‚ú®Working with Command Line Environment is always better than Using manual approach of GUI which leads us towards Automation World .
### üî∞ So , In this project,  I have build basic cloud Environment using CLI of AWS Cloud without going to AWS GUI Console .
