## Answer 
1. Amazon S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the Internet. Itâ€™s a simple storage service that offers an extremely durable, highly available, and infinitely scalable data storage infrastructure at very low costs.
1. An object is a file and any optional metadata that describes the file. To store a file in Amazon S3, you upload it to a bucket. When you upload a file as an object, you can set permissions on the object and any metadata. Buckets are containers for objects. You can have one or more buckets.
1. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional charge.
1. Serverless is the native architecture of the cloud that enables you to shift more of your operational responsibilities to AWS, increasing your agility and innovation. Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers.
1. Format of object URL:  https://<bucket_name>.s3-aws-region.amazonaws.com/object_name
1. Amazon S3 can be accessed from anywhere. AWS EBS is only available in a particular region, while you can share files between regions on multiple EFS instances.
